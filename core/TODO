- need to create and store ResourceLocation objects and pass to UI.bindTexture() instead of allocating on each call

- Widget class
	- adds itself to a list that is automatically handled by GuiContainerAU
	- TextField will inherit this, all TextField code in GuiContainerAU will become Widget code
	- Label Class
		- for displaying static text on Guis
		- hud options needs this

- icon buttons
	- displays image to the right or left of the button text
	- two images for state buttons
	- hud can display checkmarks to the left of its state buttons

- warning system for protection violating items
	- chroma sprayer and cube manipulator would use it
	- display chat message when OPs login, MP only
	- core mod option to disable message, should only be done once the item is added to the protection plugin
