Connected textures on glass are missing inside edges when connecting diagonally with
same color glass or any other block

Not an issue, but glass should always display its frame on all six sides and not just
the 1-3 sides the player can see. Connected textures between same color glass should
the only thing that eliminates some sides of the frame.
