~ FIX: stairs and slabs absorb other light sources and emit that light when the sources are removed
	- the lighting hack causes this

~ FIX: prevent powered lamps from appearing in NEI

~ forge multipart support
	- OR colored slabs

- lamp and inverted lamp that light up but don't emit light, use glowstone dust instead of glowstone block

- config option to add additional block IDs that should receive the lighting hack (stairs and slabs from other mods)

- render all 6 sides of glass, option to disable
	- causes flickering from a distance and minor gaps between interior textures

- grated floor
	- frame around outside edge, connected textures
	- near top of block, similar to trapdoors

- key or item to feign death
	- lay down as if on a bed
	- make mobs ignore player
