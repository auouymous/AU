- forge multipart support

- change iron bar texture to something that would be symmetrical in horizontal orientation?

- semi-transparent icons for tinted glass panes

- remove all support for 1.5.2 or fix language file issue

- MC18x
	- remove recipe to craft chiseled stone bricks

----------

CHROMA INFUSER
	- optimize TileEntityChromaInfuser.updateEntity()

	- FIX: ChromaRegistry.addRecipe() can't get localized names for input/output itemstacks from AU Extras (error output only)

	- allow color specific recipes, to map each color to a separate ID:metadata, instead of only metadata
		- add recipes for artificial vines

	- chroma infuser shouldn't process a colored item with the same color, unless converting item IDs for it
		- need to add a colored flag to ChromeRecipe and set in all conversion recipes
		- the item input slot should reject the item if chroma infuser has dye, if no dye, processing should reject it
		- NEI plugin merges conversion recipes and will need to handle the missing color

	- display 4 chroma recipes per NEI page (2 might be max)

	- display bubbles in chroma infuser's water and play a sound when processing items

- itemChromaSprayer
	- CRAFT 1 piston + 1 chroma infuser + 1 wool
	- right click on a block to change its color
	- right click with empty sprayer to remove color, for most blocks
	- fill or empty sprayers in chroma infuser
	- each sprayers holds 256 uses (32 dye)

----------

- lamp and inverted lamp that light up but don't emit light, use glowstone dust instead of glowstone block

- mini lamps that can be placed on walls, ceiling or floor
	- size of a lamp in an item frame (5x5x4 deep)
	- redstone control, normal and inverted variants
	- use a TE to hold orientation and style (right click to change style)
	- default style is lamp on a base
	- one style will use the iron bars texture as a cage around the lamp, on a base
	- some styles will change depth and size of lamp cube
	- some styles will change style of the base

- lamp buttons and levers
	- the buttons will be colored and glow briefly when pressed (they wont emit light)
	- the levers will have a colored base that glows when active
		- will have a flush two position switch on the front instead of a lever

- colored glow glass and panes, 3 types (6 block IDs)
	- crafted with any colored glass and 1 glowstone dust per
	- would connect to its non-glow variant

----------

- colored water blocks, still and flowing(?)
	- colored water buckets, right click a chroma infuser with 8 dye volume to fill bucket
	- fill bucket with normal water if no dye
	- water remains in the chroma infuser, can be used as an infinite water source

- walls
	- for all au_extras blocks
	- for sandstone, nether brick and quartz
- fences and gates
	- for all au_extras blocks
	- for sandstone and quartz, cobble?

----------

- colored signs
	- 16 colors but they also support block camo
	- IRotatableBlock
		- flat and stick positions
	- support colored text on the signs

- sign editor
	- this could bypass protection, need to check if player can break the sign
	- item that can record sign text by shift right clicking one
	- right click item in air to open editor
		- option to set text color and block camo (for colored signs)
	- right click a sign to apply text

----------

- connected textures for vanilla blocks?
	- option to disable if something like optifine does it
	- this would allow all clients to see the same thing

- key or item to feign death
	- lay down as if on a bed
	- make mobs ignore player
