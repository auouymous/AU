~ FIX: flower rendering

~ FIX: stairs and slabs absorb other light sources and emit that light when the sources are removed
	- the lighting hack causes this





~ FIX: prevent powered lamps from appearing in NEI

~ FIX: ChromaRegistry.addRecipe() can't get localized names for input/output itemstacks from AU Extras

-----

- NEI support for chroma infuser recipes

- chroma infuser shouldn't process a colored item with the same color, unless converting item IDs for it
	- need to add a colored flag to ChromeRecipe and set in all conversion recipes

- add tooltip to recipe button output images

- add flowers to world gen

- check biome when growing flowers and decrease odds for colors not in current biome
	- option to only grow colors for current biome

- display bubbles in chroma infuser's water and play a sound when processing items

- add a flower pot that supports these flowers
	- maybe use a tile entity and support all flowers

~ forge multipart support
	- OR colored slabs

- MC174
	- glass/pane + BLANK_BUTTON -> stained glass/pane

- lamp and inverted lamp that light up but don't emit light, use glowstone dust instead of glowstone block

- grated floor
	- frame around outside edge, connected textures
	- near top of block, similar to trapdoors
