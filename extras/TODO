~ change iron bar texture to something that would be symmetrical in horizontal orientation?

~ render chiseled brick and smooth brick slabs with ambient occlusion

- allow vines to be placed on sides of other vines, avoiding the need to place blocks to place the vines on

- semi-transparent icons for tinted glass panes

- remove all support for 1.5.2 or fix language file issue

- MC18x

----------

CHROMA INFUSER
	- optimize TileEntityChromaInfuser.updateEntity()

	- FIX: ChromaRegistry.addRecipe() can't get localized names for input/output itemstacks from AU Extras (error output only)

	~ allow color specific recipes, to map each color to a separate ID:metadata, instead of only metadata
		- add recipes for artificial vines

	- chroma infuser shouldn't process a colored item with the same color, unless converting item IDs for it
		- need to add a colored flag to ChromeRecipe and set in all conversion recipes
		- the item input slot should reject the item if chroma infuser has dye, if no dye, processing should reject it
		- NEI plugin merges conversion recipes and will need to handle the missing color

	- display 4 chroma recipes per NEI page (2 might be max)

	- display bubbles in chroma infuser's water and play a sound when processing items

- itemChromaSprayer
	- CRAFT 1 piston + 1 chroma infuser + 1 wool
	- right click on a block to change its color
	- right click with empty sprayer to remove color, for most blocks

	- size of a lamp in an item frame (5x5x4 deep)
	- redstone control, normal and inverted variants
	- use a TE to hold orientation and style (right click to change style)
	- default style is lamp on a base
	- one style will use the iron bars texture as a cage around the lamp, on a base
	- some styles will change depth and size of lamp cube
	- some styles will change style of the base

- lamp buttons and levers
	- the buttons will be colored and glow briefly when pressed (they wont emit light)
	- the levers will have a colored base that glows when active
		- will have a flush two position switch on the front instead of a lever

- colored glow glass and panes, 3 types (6 block IDs)
	- crafted with any colored glass and 1 glowstone dust per
	- would connect to its non-glow variant

----------

- colored water blocks, still and flowing(?)
	- colored water buckets, right click a chroma infuser with 8 dye volume to fill bucket

----------

- colored signs
