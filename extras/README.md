The Chroma Infuser is used to color vanilla blocks and create and color some new blocks.
Place a water bucket in its UI to add a permanent water supply or to clear dye.
Place dye in UI to color the water, can be inserted via pipes from sides.
Place blocks in top UI slot and click one of the four recipe buttons.
Click the downward arrow in UI to begin crafting, click again to stop.
Items can be piped in from top and extracted from bottom.
Rain can set the water supply and clear dye, put a roof over them or disable this in the config. :)

The Ender Cube is used to teleport players and entities to other cubes, in any direction.
Ender Cubes must have at least two air blocks above each cube, although some blocks are allowed:
	pressure plates, buttons, levers, rails, signs, torches and trip wires.
Stand on an Ender Cube and sneak to teleport down/north/west, jump to teleport up/south/east.
The jump/sneak actions are limited to players in the whitelist, clear it to allow all.
A redstone signal may also be used to teleport all entities above the cube to another cube.
Maximum distance between Cubes is 16, adjustable in the config.
Drop any block in the slot to camouflage the Ender Cube as that block.

Flower seeds produce biome-specific flowers 75% of the time and all flowers the other 25%.
Can be changed in config to always produce all colors.

Colored glass panes and colored iron bars support vertical and horizontal orientation.

Artificial grass comes in 16 biome-independent shades, without dirt sides/bottom.
Silk touch is not required to pick up artificial grass.
Passive mobs will not spawn on artificial grass.
Sheep will not eat your artificial grass.
Artificial grass does not spread to nearby dirt.

Artificial vine comes in 16 biome-independent shades, does not spread.
Two artificial vines can be placed in the same block space.
Artificial vines remain when supporting blocks are removed.
Shears are still required to break artificial vines.
